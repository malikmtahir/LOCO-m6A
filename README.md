N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a crucial post-transcriptional modification in various biological processes, regulating RNA stability, splicing, translation, and degradation. Dysregulation of m6A is linked to human diseases like cancer, neurological disorders, metabolic diseases, and immune-related conditions. Existing machine learning approaches often cause data leakage, inflated performance metrics, and poor generalization. This paper proposes a Leave-One-Chromosome-Out (LOCO) approach for m6A identification, avoiding the chance for the model to see data patterns during training. The LOCO-m6A model integrates a convolutional neural network with multi-feature techniques, and three variants were trained on a m6A benchmark dataset. The results showed superior performance in accuracy, specificity, and AUC ROC metrics compared to existing models.
